## Who we’ve worked with

We’ve earned our stripes working on digital products and design systems for some of the very best organisations and teams including:

## Our ethos

We prioritise projects that make a positive difference to people’s lives.

We strive to be open, inclusive and socially-responsible in the work we do.

We think the web should be simple, straightforward and open to everyone. We aim for clarity and usability above all else.

## Let’s talk

If you’re interested in the support we offer, we’d love to chat. Drop us an email at hello@wearefrankly.co and we’ll get in touch.

## Amy

Hi, I’m Amy. I’m the brains behind this operation ;)

I spent 3 years as content lead for the GOV.‌UK Design System. Right now, I’m contracting as product manager for the design system at Babylon Health.

I’ve also worked as researcher, writer and editor at consumer charity Which?, producing content on everything from compost to conveyancing.

I care about making services accessible and inclusive, starting with the basics – the words we use to talk about them.

## Adam

Hello, I’m Adam.

I’ve been designing and building web things for 20 years for a whole load of different organisations including Tesco, BBC, Just Eat, Selfridges, The Financial Times and many more.

Most recently I’ve been helping various government departments design and launch services that are useful, usable and accessible.

I wrote a book on how to design forms, published by Smashing Magazine.

My modus operandi is creating simple and inclusive interfaces and interactions that nail the basics, avoid complexity and solve real user problems.
