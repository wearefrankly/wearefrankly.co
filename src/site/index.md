## Our ethos

## About Amy

Hi, I’m Amy. I’m the brains behind this operation ;)

I spent 3 years as content lead for the GOV.‌UK Design System. Right now, I’m contracting as product manager for the design system at Babylon Health.

I’ve also worked as researcher, writer and editor at consumer charity Which?, producing content on everything from compost to conveyancing.

I care about making services accessible and inclusive, starting with the basics – the words we use to talk about them.

## About Adam

Hello, I’m Adam.

I’ve been designing and building web things for 20 years for a whole load of different organisations including Tesco, BBC, Just Eat, Selfridges, The Financial Times and many more.

Most recently I’ve been helping various government departments design and launch services that are useful, usable and accessible.

I wrote a book on how to design forms, published by Smashing Magazine.

My modus operandi is creating simple and inclusive interfaces and interactions that nail the basics, avoid complexity and solve real user problems.
